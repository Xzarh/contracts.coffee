  Contracts.coffee is an extension to CoffeeScript that adds contracts.

  Contracts allow you to write powerful runtime assertions about your code. 
  Like types but less painful, like assert but more useful.

  square :: (Num) -> Num
  square = (x) -> x * x

  Install Node.js, and then the CoffeeScript compiler:
  sudo bin/cake install

  Compile a script:
  coffee -cC /path/to/script.coffee

  The -C flag enables contracts in the generated JavaScript.
  If you want to disable contracts simple leave off the flag.

  For documentation, usage, and examples of Contracts.coffee see:
  http://disnetdev.com/contracts.coffee/

  For documentation, usage, and examples of CoffeeScript see:
  http://coffeescript.org/

  Note that Contracts.coffee requires some pretty new features of Javascript 
  (in particular Proxies: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) 
  so it currently only works on Firefox 4+ but other JavaScript engines should
  be adding support soon.
